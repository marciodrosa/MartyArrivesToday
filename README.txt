The site is a joke with the Back to the Future movie series.

Last week, a hoax appeared on Facebook, saying that Marty McFly arrived today with the Delorean time machine (it was 06.27.2012), using a (bad) photoshoped printscreen of the Delorean's console to prove it. It was not the first time that people were deceived. The actual date is 10.21.2015.

So, this site is a parody of this hoax. Here, the Delorean's computer always shows the current date.
